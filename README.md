# CBE
This is a python based model gui which calculates coefficients of unbalanced chemical equation to balance the whole equation.
Concept:
1. I am using python package numpy and sympy. The idea is to model unknown coefficients into a matrix where it is guaranteed that the matrix will have nullspace with no zero entries in it. Nullspace of the matrix will be the solution of vector of unknown coefficients.
